CS/CE/TE 6378: Advanced Operating SystemsSection 002Project 1Instructor: Neeraj MittalAssigned on: Thursday, September 1, 2016Due date: Thursday September 22, 2016This is an individual project. Code sharing among students is strictly prohibited and will resultin disciplinary action being taken.You can do this project in C, C++ or Java. Each student is expected to demonstrate theoperation of this project to the instructor or the TA. Since the project involves socket programming,you can only use machines dcXX.utdallas.edu, where XX 2 f01, 02, .., 45g, for running the program.Although you may develop the project on any platform, the demonstration has to be on dcXXmachines; otherwise, you will be assessed a penalty of 20%.1 Project DescriptionImplement a distributed system consisting of n nodes. The value of n and the location of each ofthe n node is specified in a configuration le. Every node selects a label value (basically an integer)uniformly at random from the interval [1; 10] in the beginning. Every node then circulates a tokenthrough the system that visits each node in the system in certain order and computes the sum ofall the label values along the way. The path taken by the token of each node is again specified inthe conguration. This path is piggybacked on the token by the node that generated the token.At the end, each node prints its label value and the sum of all the label values computed by itstoken. Note that the path may contain cycles and/or may not contain all the nodes. The tokenshould simply traverse the nodes in the order specied in the path even if it means visiting a node(and adding its number) more than once.You can assume that each node generates exactly one token. Also, once a node's token has finished its traversal, the node writes its label value and the final sum computed by its token to its own output le.Termination: After writing the output, a node broadcasts a COMPLETE message to all othernodes, waits to receive COMPLETE message from all other nodes and then halts.Bonus Points: You can earn 10% bonus points by using SCTP rather than TCP sockets forcommunication.2 Submission InformationAll the submission will be through eLearning. Submit all the source necessary to compile theprogram and run it. 
Also, submit a README that contains instructions to compile and runyour program.2
